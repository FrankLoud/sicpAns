# Question
Exercise 1.14.  Draw the tree illustrating the process generated by the count-change procedure of section 1.2.2 in making change for 11 cents. What are the orders of growth of the space and number of steps used by this process as the amount to be changed increases?

# Answer
## Process tree of (count-change 11)

## Order of growth of the space
Because 'space is proportional to the maximun depth of the tree', and the maxmun depth of the process tree is n when find the change with n 1 cent. So space = theta(n)

## Order of growth of the steps
time = theta(2^n) **not sure**
