# Question
Exercise 2.16.

# Answer
I think this is because when an interval I1 operates with I2 and get I3, the percentage tolerances of I3 is bigger than I1 as width of I2 is not 0, this means the times of operation between two intervals(width is not 0) affects the percenttage tolerances.

I think there is not such inerval-arithmetic package that can solve this problem because it's not the problemof the packge but the 'problem' of interval operations itself.

I think Alyssa's implementation of interval is good enough, and when other programmer use the interval operations, they should think in 'interval' but not in 'algebra'.
