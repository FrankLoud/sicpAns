#Question 
Exercise 1.9.  Each of the following two procedures defines a method for adding two positive integers in terms of the procedures inc, which increments its argument by 1, and dec, which decrements its argument by 1.

    (define (+ a b)
      (if (= a 0)
          b
          (inc (+ (dec a) b))))
    
    (define (+ a b)
      (if (= a 0)
          b
          (+ (dec a) (inc b))))
    
Using the substitution model, illustrate the process generated by each procedure in evaluating (+ 4 5). Are these processes iterative or recursive?

#Analyzing
## Code A
    
    (define (+ a b)
      (if (= a 0) b (inc (+ (dec a) b))))

Substitution process:
 
    (+ 4 5)

    (inc (+ (dec 4) 5))
    (inc (+ 3 5))

    (inc (inc (+ (dec 3) 5)))
    (inc (inc (+ 2 5)))

    (inc (inc (inc (+ (dec 2) 5))))
    (inc (inc (inc (+ 1 5))))

    (inc (inc (inc (inc (+ (dec 1) 5)))))
    (inc (inc (inc (inc (+ 0 5)))))

    (inc (inc (inc (inc 5))))

    (inc (inc (inc 6)))

    (inc (inc 7)

    (inc 8)
 
    9

替换的过程构成了`a chain of deferred operations`，所以这是一个recursive process.

## Code B

    (define  (+ a b)
      (if (= a 0) b (+ (dec a) (inc b))))

Substitution process:

    (+ 4 5)

    (+ (dec 4) (inc 5))
    (+ 3 6)

    (+ (dec 3) (inc 6))
    (+ 2 7)

    (+ (dec 2) (inc 7))
    (+ 1 8)

    (+ (dec 1) (inc 8))
    (+ 0 9)

    9

替换的过程中，每一步的状态都可以被2个`state variable`所记录，所以这是一个iterative process.
